# Project Proposal - CryptoZombies Extension
## Vision Statement
This project aims to build a comprehensive front-end interface for a blockchain-based zombie game, extending from the CryptoZombies tutorial. It will involve working with Web3.js, smart contracts, and the React or Svelte front-end framework. The end goal is to create a functional and intuitive UI that interacts seamlessly with Ethereum smart contracts. This project will enhance my skills in blockchain development, front-end frameworks, and software architecture, preparing me for a diversified role in the tech industry.

## Motivation
Prior to UC Boulder, I worked in the digital asset industry, and I am eager to dive deeper into the web3 technologies I had only a surface level understanding of before. I'd also like to better understand the relevant development and deployment tools like the Truffle framework as well as my desire to apply front-end development skills in a real-world application. 

## Specific and Measurable Goals
- Implement core game functionalities such as attack, changeName, changeDna, and ERC721 functions in the front-end within 3 weeks.
- Develop an admin page with restricted functionalities based on the Ethereum address within 1 week.
- Create user views including individual zombie pages, user pages, and the homepage within 4 weeks.
- Integrate real-time notifications and events within 2 weeks.
- Optimize front-end performance by implementing caching strategies within 1 week.
- Document the code and write a final project report by the end of the semester.

### Risks to Project Completion: 
- No prior experience working with a front-end framework like React or Svelte
- Limited understanding of blockchain events and real-time notifications.
- Unfamiliarity with front-end caching strategies.
  
### Mitigation Strategy
- For the first risk, I plan to dedicate the initial weeks to learn the basics of the Svelte framework.
- To address the second risk, I will go through documentation and tutorials on Ethereum events.
- For the last risk, I'll research effective caching strategies and perhaps find libraries that can aid in this aspect.
  
## Project Assessments
The project will be considered complete when all the goals are met, the code is documented, and the final project report is written, summarizing the learnings, achievements, and any future scope.
- Functionality: Does the interface implement all listed features?
- Usability: Is the interface user-friendly?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, documented, and maintainable?
- Performance: Does the application run smoothly, with optimized calls to the blockchain?
- Documentation: Is the project well-documented including a final report?
