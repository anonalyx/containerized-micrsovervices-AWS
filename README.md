Project Proposal for Containerized Microservices Deployment on AWS Using Docker and Kubernetes

# Vision Statement
My goal is to design, build, and deploy a proof-of-concept system that utilizes a microservices architecture on AWS using Docker containers and orchestrated using Kubernetes. This will expand my professional skills in cloud computing, container orchestration, and DevOps practices, positioning me as a proficient full-stack developer with a specialization in cloud-based solutions. Data scale cloud computing is interesting to me and I've already noticed some of the complexity in working with cloud-hosted data.

# Motivation
Systems design is the area of computer science I am most interested in, and while I don't have much direct experience with cloud computing and containerization technologies I am interested to push myself and learn more about them. This project will be a great first step towards bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. It will also serve as a portfolio project demonstrating my capabilities in these areas.

# Specific and Measurable Goals (Learning Objectives)

Design a Microservices Architecture: Draft a blueprint for a User Service that manages authentication, profile, and other administrative activities related to user identity
Containerize Services using Docker: Each service will be encapsulated into a Docker container.
Orchestrate using Kubernetes: Deploy each service on a Kubernetes cluster.
AWS Integration: Utilize AWS services like S3 for cloud data.

# Risks to Project Completion
New Working Environment: Lack of hands-on experience with Kubernetes and AWS services.
Learning Curve: Complexity of microservices orchestration.
Resource Constraints: Cost associated with AWS services.

# Mitigation Strategy
Tutorials and Documentation: Allocate time to study AWS and Kubernetes documentation.
Scope Limitation: Stick to a small, manageable number of microservices.
Free Tiers and Grants: Utilize AWS Educate credits and free tiers to minimize costs.

# Project Assessments
Functionality: All microservices should function as designed.
Scalability: The architecture should handle increased load gracefully.
Cost-Effectiveness: Stay within the budget for AWS services.
Monitoring: Successful implementation of monitoring tools.

# Project Completion Criteria

All microservices are deployed and functional
Monitoring tools are effectively tracking performance metrics
All code and documentation are uploaded to GitHub
